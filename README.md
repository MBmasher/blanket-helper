# blanket-helper
A program to help with blanketing objects in osu!.

The program window is top-most, meaning that the program window will be on top of osu! even if the osu window is focused. However, this only works if the osu window is not in fullscreen mode.

Note that this program only finds blankets for "perfect" sliders, sliders that consist of a start, mid and end point. Their slider body is made up of the circle arc from those three points, meaning that all this program does is find the centre of the circle that the slider body's arc is made up of.
